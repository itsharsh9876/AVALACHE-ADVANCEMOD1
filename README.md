### Subnet 
 
Follow the below github repository's readme file in order to install avalanche CLI to your Ubuntu or Mac terminal:
 
 [https://docs.avax.network/tooling/cli-guides/install-avalanche-cli](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli)

 Helping Resource: https://docs.avax.network/tooling/cli-create-deploy-subnets/create-subnet

In order to create a subnet, we run -


avalanche subnet create mySubnet


In order to deploy the created subnet, we run -


avalanche subnet deploy mySubnet


To connect your subnet to metamask, you will need to :

* Add network manually and enter Name, RPC URL, Token Symbol and Chain ID that you entered while creating the subnet.
* Import account with test tokens by entering the private key that you get from the terminal after you deploy the subnet.
